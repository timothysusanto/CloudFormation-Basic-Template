AWS CloudFormation allows you to model your entire infrastructure and application resources with either a text file or programming languages.
Codifying your infrastructure allows you to treat your infrastructure as just code. CloudFormation takes care of determining the right operations to perform when managing your stack, orchestrating them in the most efficient way, and rolls back changes automatically if errors are detected.
